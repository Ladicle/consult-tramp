#+title: README

This package provides an interface be able to interact with remote hosts via
consult and tramp. Candidates are selected from a number of pre-defined sources
which currently are:

- User's SSH config file (defined via =consult-tramp-ssh-config=)
- User's known hosts file (defined via =consult-tramp-known-hosts=)
- Currently running docker containers

It's also possible to include/exclude these sources at the user's will.

For creating other sources, reference the current examples to create a new
source and add it to the =consult-tramp-sources= list.

Also see  [[https://github.com/minad/consult][consult]] documentation for further reading and explanation.

After selecting a host, the default action defined by
=consult-tramp-default-action= will be called using the
defined host as the =default-directory=. If prefix arg is specified, then the
function will be called interactively.

The default path for all hosts is specified via =consult-tramp-path=
(=consult-tramp-docker-path=  for Docker containers), but this is currently a
global setting.

The above shows a (blurred for privacy) example. Upon entering one of the narrow
keys for =L= ocal, =S= SH config, =K= nown hosts or =D= ocker; only that kind of host
will be shown.

* Installation

Install using your package manager of choice, an example use-package & straight
recipe might look like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package consult-tramp
  :recipe (:host github :repo "Ladicle/consult-tramp"))
#+end_src

If you want docker candidates to show up, you will also have to include
[[https://github.com/emacs-pe/docker-tramp.el][docker-tramp]]. If not, it might be preferable to adjust =consult-tramp-sources= to
remove the docker source.
